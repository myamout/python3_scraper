# python3_scraper
This is a quick script that will access a subreddit and download the imgur images off of the first page.
The files will be downloaded straight into the folder that the program file is in, therefore you may want to set your wallpaper to cycle through images in the folder the script resides in. 
The program is written in Python 3 and uses the regular expressions and url library to access the internet and obtain the image links and files.
